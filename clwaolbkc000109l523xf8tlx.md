## IoT

### Definition

`Internet of Things means a network of physical things (objects) sending, receiving, or communicating information using the Internet or other communication technologies and network just as the computers, tablets and mobiles do, and thus enabling the monitoring, coordinating or controlling process across the Internet or another data network.`

**OR**

`Internet of Things is the network of physical objects or ‘things’ embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure`.

### IoT Vision

Vision of IoT—`things becoming intelligent, smart and behaving alive.`

### Hyperconnectivity

Hyperconnectivity means ‘`constant connectivity between devices, network, server and multiple systems`’.

Hyperconnectivity refers to the state of being constantly connected to multiple systems, devices, networks, and streams of information. It enables seamless communication and data exchange between various entities, facilitating real-time interactions and access to information across different platforms. In simpler terms, hyperconnectivity ensures that devices, networks, servers, and systems are consistently linked and able to communicate with each other without interruption.

## IoT Conceptual Framework

* Adrian McEwen and Hakim Cassimally equation is a simple conceptualisation of a framework for IoT with connectivity to a web service:
    
    **Physical Object + Controller, Sensor and Actuators + Internet = Internet of Things**
    
* An equation to conceptualise a general framework for IoT with connectivity to a data centre, application or enterprise server for data storage, services and business processes is:
    
    **Gather + Enrich + Stream + Manage + Acquire + Organise and Analyse = Internet of Things**
    
    Orcale suggested IoT architecture is the basis for this equation.
    
* Another equation which conceptualises the general framework for IoT using the cloud based services is:
    
    **Gather + Consolidate + Connect + Collect + Assemble + Manage and Analyse = Internet of Things**

## IoT Architectural View

IoT systems are layered, with each layer handling a specific function. These layers are also called tiers. Think of them as building blocks that work together. A reference model, like a blueprint, helps us visualize these blocks and how they interact. For instance, Cisco's reference model has seven levels, showing how data flows from sensors to applications.

An IoT reference model suggested by CISCO that gives a conceptual framework for a general IoT system:

### Sensors and Control Units

**Sensors**

Sensors are devices that convert physical energy such as heat, sound, strain, pressure, vibrations, and motion into electrical energy. They are essential components in IoT applications for collecting data from the physical environment.

Sensors can be categorized into two main types - analog and digital. Analog sensors provide continuous output signals, while digital sensors generate discrete binary output signals.

**Control Units**

Control units are essential components in IoT systems that help in managing and regulating various processes and devices based on input commands or signals. An actuator, which is a key part of a control unit, converts electrical energy into physical action based on the input it receives. Examples of actuators used in IoT applications include light sources like LEDs, piezoelectric vibrators and sounders, speakers, solenoids, servomotors, relay switches, and more..

Control units play a crucial role in various IoT applications, such as controlling traffic lights, managing vehicle operations like applying brakes, switching on/off heating or cooling systems, and even controlling industrial processes like steam boilers in thermal plants. These units enable the automation and efficient functioning of interconnected devices and systems in IoT environments.

The most commonly used control unit in IoT is a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) or a custom chip, which is an integrated chip or core in a VLSI or SoC. Popular microcontrollers used in IoT include ATmega 328, ATMega 32u4, ARM Cortex, and ARM LPC.

Various functional units in an MCU that are embedded in an IoT device or a physical object:

**Communication Module**

The communication module in IoT applications includes a protocol handler, message queue, and message cache for message transmission and reception. `This module facilitates the exchange of messages between connected devices and the web using various communication protocols.`

Key functions of the communication module include:

1. **Protocol Handler**: Manages the transmission and reception of messages according to specified communication protocols.
    
2. **Message Queue**: Stores messages until they are transmitted to their destination, ensuring efficient message delivery.
    
3. **Message Cache**: Stores incoming messages until they are processed and saved within the module.
    

The communication module enables different message exchange patterns, such as:

* **Request/Response (Client/Server)**: Involves a client requesting resources from a server, with the server responding accordingly. This interaction is commonly used in HTTP and RESTful services.
    
* **Publish/Subscribe (PubSub)**: Allows services to publish messages that can be subscribed to by clients or brokers. This pattern is useful for scenarios like weather information services or sensor data dissemination.
    

**Software**

IoT software consists of two components—software at the IoT device and software at the IoT server.

**Middleware**

Middleware refers to software that acts as a bridge between different systems or components, enabling them to communicate and work together seamlessly. Middleware facilitates data exchange, message routing, and integration between various applications or devices. It plays a crucial role in enabling interoperability and communication in complex systems by abstracting the underlying complexities and providing a standardized interface for interactions.

OpenIoT is an open source middleware. It enables communication with sensor clouds as well as cloud-based ‘sensing as a service’. IoTSyS is a middleware which enables provisioning of communication stack for smart devices using IPv6, oBIX, 6LoWPAN, CoAP and multiple standards and protocols. The oBIX is standard XML and web services protocol oBIX (Open Building Information Xchange).

**Operating Systems (OS)**

IoT operating systems are crucial for managing connected devices efficiently. Some examples of IoT operating systems include:

1. **Contiki**: Known for its low power consumption and scalability, Contiki is a popular choice for IoT applications due to its small footprint and support for various IoT protocols. It is widely used in wireless sensor networks.

### **IoT Protocols**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715570360449/a0543975-91a8-4fde-8c72-a0a4ee471199.png align="center")

* **Link Layer**
    
    Link layer protocols manage the physical transmission of data over a network's physical medium (e.g., copper wire, coaxial cable, or radio waves). They operate within the local network connection that hosts are attached to, allowing hosts on the same link to exchange data packets. These protocols define how packets are coded and signaled by the hardware over the connected medium.

        Data rates – 9.6 Kb/s (for 2G) to upto 100 Mb/s (for 4G)
        
* **Network/Internet Layer**
    
    The network layer sends IP datagrams from the source network to the destination network, handling host addressing and packet routing. Datagrams include source and destination addresses for routing across multiple networks.
    
    Host identification uses hierarchical IP addressing schemes like IPv4 or IPv6.
    
    1. **IPv4**
        
        Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the most widely used Internet protocol for identifying devices on a network with a 32-bit address scheme, allowing for 4,294,967,296 addresses.
        
    2. **IPv6**
        
        Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the successor to IPv4, using a 128-bit address scheme that supports 3.4 x 10^38 addresses
        
    3. **6LoWPAN**
        
        6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) enables the use of the IP protocol on low-power devices with limited processing capabilities.
        
* **Transport Layer**
    
    Transport layer protocols offer end-to-end message transfer independently of the underlying network. This can be connection-oriented with handshakes (TCP) or connectionless without handshakes/acknowledgements (UDP). The transport layer handles error control, segmentation, flow control, and congestion control.
    
    1. **TCP**
        
        Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most widely used transport layer protocol, utilized by web browsers (with HTTP and HTTPS), email programs (SMTP), and for file transfer (FTP). TCP is connection-oriented and stateful, ensuring reliable, in-order packet transmission. It provides error detection to discard duplicates and retransmit lost packets. TCP's flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver, and its congestion control avoids network congestion and collapse, maintaining network performance.
        
    2. **UDP**
        
        Unlike TCP, which requires an initial setup, UDP is a connectionless protocol. It's useful for time-sensitive applications with small data units that don't need the overhead of connection setup. UDP is transaction-oriented and stateless, not providing guaranteed delivery, message ordering, or duplicate elimination. Higher-level protocols can ensure reliable delivery or reliable connections if needed.
        
* **Application Layer**
    
    Application layer protocols govern how applications interact with lower layer protocols to transmit data across a network. They encode application data, encapsulating it within the transport layer protocol, which facilitates connection or transaction-oriented communication over the network. Application layer protocols utilize port numbers for addressing, enabling process-to-process connections.

        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715948590766/d7163a03-4da1-4ca0-87e1-38a0c7fa2b7d.png align="center")
        

### **IoT Communication APIs**

#### REST-based Communication APIs

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a set of architectural principles for designing web services and web APIs that focus on system resources and their state management.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715949131499/218087d6-5eeb-496d-9acd-8448c8bf1fe8.png align="center")

**Key REST Architectural Constraints:**

* **Client-Server**: Separation of concerns between client and server. The client handles the user interface, while the server manages data storage.
    
* **Stateless**: Each client request to the server must contain all necessary information, with no reliance on stored context on the server.
    
* **Cache-able**: Responses must indicate whether they are cacheable to improve efficiency and scalability by reducing unnecessary interactions.
    
* **Layered System**: The client interacts with a single layer, unaware of intermediaries. This can improve system scalability.
    
* **Uniform Interface**: A consistent method of communication between client and server. Resources are identified by URIs, and clients interact with resource representations.
    
* **Code on Demand**: Servers can send executable code to clients (optional constraint).
    

**RESTful Web Services:**

* Implemented using HTTP and REST principles.
    
* Resources are identified by URIs (e.g., [`http://example.com/api/tasks/`](http://example.com/api/tasks/)).
    
* Clients use HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to interact with resources.
    
* Supports various Internet media types, with JSON being the most common for RESTful services.
    

RESTful web services are widely used for their simplicity and scalability, suitable for various IoT applications.

#### WebSocket-based Communication APIs

WebSocket APIs enable bi-directional, full-duplex communication between clients and servers, following the exclusive pair communication model.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715949173019/3fd18306-dbfb-49d3-9796-9ee9d3e224d5.png align="center")

**Key Features of WebSocket APIs:**

* **Connection Setup**: Begins with a WebSocket handshake sent by the client over HTTP. The server responds to the handshake, upgrading the connection to a WebSocket.
    
* **Full-Duplex Communication**: Once the connection is established, data can flow in both directions simultaneously without needing to re-establish connections for each message.
    
* **Reduced Network Traffic and Latency**: No overhead for connection setup and termination with each message, making it suitable for applications requiring low latency and high throughput.
    

**WebSocket API Use Cases:**

* Ideal for IoT applications needing real-time data exchange, such as live updates, chat applications, or telemetry data streaming.
    

WebSocket APIs are particularly advantageous for IoT scenarios that demand efficient, continuous, and real-time communication.

## IoT Enablers

IoT is enabled by several technologies including wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, big data analytics, embedded systems, security protocols and architectures, communication protocols, web services, mobile Internet, and semantic search engines.

### Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) comprises distributed devices with sensors used to monitor environmental and physical conditions. A typical WSN includes end-nodes, routers, and a coordinator:

* **End-Nodes**: These nodes have attached sensors for data collection. They can also act as routers.
    
* **Routers**: Responsible for routing data packets from end-nodes to the coordinator.
    
* **Coordinator**: Collects data from all nodes and acts as a gateway to connect the WSN to the Internet.
    

**Examples of WSNs in IoT:**

* **Weather Monitoring Systems**: Nodes collect temperature, humidity, and other data for aggregation and analysis.
