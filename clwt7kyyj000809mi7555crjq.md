### TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)

TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach), translated as the "Theory of Inventive Problem Solving," is a systematic approach for understanding and solving complex problems, especially in the field of engineering and technology. Developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues in the Soviet Union beginning in 1946, TRIZ is based on the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature.

**Definition**:

* A problem-solving, analysis, and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature.
    

#### Key Principles of TRIZ

1. **Contradiction**:
    
    * Central to TRIZ is the concept of contradictions, which are obstacles that prevent the achievement of an ideal solution.
        
    * **Technical Contradictions**: Situations where improving one parameter leads to the worsening of another.
        
    * **Physical Contradictions**: Situations where an element needs to have opposing properties (e.g., being both hot and cold).
        
2. **Ideality**:
    
    * The notion of ideality refers to the state where a system performs its function without any negative consequences or additional resources.
        
    * The goal of TRIZ is to approach this ideal state by resolving contradictions and eliminating inefficiencies.
        
3. **Patterns of Evolution**:
    
    * TRIZ identifies patterns in the way technical systems evolve over time. These patterns help predict future developments and guide innovative problem solving.
        
    * Common patterns include increasing dynamism, improving controllability, and transitioning from macro to micro levels.
        
4. **Inventive Principles**:
    
    * TRIZ includes 40 inventive principles that provide generalized solutions to common contradictions.
        
    * Examples include segmentation, universality, nested doll, and self-service.
        
5. **Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (ARIZ)**:
    
    * ARIZ is a structured approach within TRIZ that guides problem solvers through a series of steps to identify and resolve contradictions.
        
    * It includes phases such as formulating the problem, analyzing the problem, and synthesizing a solution.
