## **Overview of Software Development Methodology and Software Quality Model**

### Software Development Methodology: Approaches to planning, designing, coding, and testing software.

Software development methodologies are structured approaches to software creation that guide the processes of planning, designing, coding, and testing.

**Purpose:** Provide a systematic way to develop software, manage projects, and ensure quality and efficiency.

**Examples of Software Development Methodologies:**

* Waterfall Model: Sequential phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance).
    
* Agile Model: Iterative and incremental development with regular feedback and adaptability.
    
* Iterative Model: Repeated cycles of planning, designing, building, and testing.
    
* Spiral Model: Combines iterative development with risk assessment and mitigation.
    

### Software Quality Models (e.g., ISO 9126)

* **Software Quality:** The degree to which a software product meets specified requirements and user expectations.
    

**ISO 9126 Quality Model:**
