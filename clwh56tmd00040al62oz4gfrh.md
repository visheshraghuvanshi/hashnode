## Introduction to Service Oriented Architecture

#### Definition

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in which application components provide services to other components via a communication protocol over a network. SOA allows different services to communicate with each other either to pass data or coordinate an activity.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Service**:
    
    * A service is a self-contained unit of functionality, such as retrieving an account balance, performing a credit check, or booking a flight. It operates independently, requiring minimal knowledge of the underlying implementation by the consumer.
        
2. **Service Provider**:
    
    * The entity that creates and offers a service. The service provider publishes a description of the service and makes it accessible to potential consumers.
        
3. **Service Consumer**:
    
    * The entity that invokes the service. It can be a software application or another service.
        
4. **Service Broker**:
    
    * An intermediary that facilitates the connection between service providers and consumers. The service broker maintains a registry of available services, allowing consumers to find and bind to them.
        

#### SOA Principles

1. **Loose Coupling**:
    
    * Services are designed to minimize dependencies on each other, promoting flexibility and ease of change.
        
2. **Service Contract**:
    
    * A formal agreement between the service provider and consumer that outlines the functionality provided and the terms of usage.
        
3. **Service Abstraction**:
    
    * Services hide the internal logic and complexities from consumers, exposing only the necessary interface.
        
4. **Service Reusability**:
    
    * Services are designed to be reusable in different applications and contexts, reducing redundancy and enhancing efficiency.
        
5. **Service Autonomy**:
    
    * Services have control over the logic they encapsulate and the resources they utilize.
        
6. **Service Statelessness**:
    
    * Services avoid retaining information between requests, ensuring scalability and simplicity.
        
7. **Service Discoverability**:
    
    * Services are designed to be easily discovered and understood by potential consumers, often through a service registry or repository.
        
8. **Service Composability**:
    
    * Services can be composed into larger, more complex services or applications, facilitating modular and scalable system development.
        

#### Benefits of SOA

1. **Interoperability**:
    
    * Facilitates communication between heterogeneous systems, allowing different technologies to work together seamlessly.
        
2. **Scalability**:
    
    * Individual services can be scaled independently to handle increased load, improving overall system performance.
        
3. **Flexibility and Agility**:
    
    * Services can be modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the system, enabling rapid adaptation to changing business requirements.
        
4. **Reusability**:
    
    * Promotes the reuse of existing services across multiple applications, reducing development time and cost.
        
5. **Cost Efficiency**:
    
    * By reusing existing services and infrastructure, organizations can achieve cost savings in both development and maintenance.
        

#### SOA Components

1. **Service Contract**:
    
    * Specifies the service interface, including input and output parameters, and any other relevant details such as usage policies.
        
2. **Service Implementation**:
    
    * The actual code that performs the service's functionality. It is hidden from the consumer, which interacts only with the service interface.
        
3. **Service Interface**:
    
    * The access point for the service, defined by the service contract. It specifies how consumers interact with the service.
        
4. **Service Repository**:
    
    * A centralized directory where service descriptions are published and can be searched by consumers.
        
5. **Service Bus**:
    
    * An enterprise service bus (ESB) is often used to handle the communication between services, providing routing, message transformation, and protocol mediation.
        

#### Example of SOA

Consider an e-commerce platform where different services such as inventory management, payment processing, shipping, and customer service are implemented as separate, loosely-coupled services. Each service can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. For instance:

* **Inventory Service**: Manages stock levels and product availability.
    
* **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing and transactions.
    
* **Shipping Service**: Manages shipping logistics and tracking.
    
* **Customer Service**: Manages customer inquiries and support tickets.
    

These services interact through a common protocol, such as REST or SOAP, and can be orchestrated to fulfill complex business processes like order fulfillment.

## Web Services

#### Definition

Web Services are standardized ways of integrating web-based applications using open standards over an internet protocol backbone. They allow different applications from different sources to communicate with each other without time-consuming custom coding.

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Interoperability**:
    
    * Web services enable interoperability between different software applications running on various platforms and frameworks.
        
2. **Extensibility**:
    
    * They can be extended with additional functionalities without affecting existing services.
        
3. **Standardized Protocols**:
    
    * They use standardized protocols like HTTP, XML, SOAP, and WSDL for communication and data exchange.
        

#### Components of Web Services

1. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:
    
    * A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It relies on XML for its message format and usually relies on other application layer protocols, most notably HTTP and SMTP, for message negotiation and transmission.
        
2. **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**:
    
    * An XML-based language used for describing the functionality offered by a web service. WSDL allows service providers to specify what the service does, where it resides, and how to invoke it.
        
3. **UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)**:
    
    * A platform-independent framework for describing services, discovering businesses, and integrating business services using the internet. UDDI is a directory for storing information about web services.
        
4. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**:
    
    * An architectural style that uses a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP. It emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.
        

#### Basic Web Services Architecture

1. **Service Provider**:
    
    * The server-side component that implements the service and publishes its interface and access information to the service registry.
        
2. **Service Consumer**:
    
    * The client-side application that locates the service in the registry and binds to it to invoke the service's functionality.
        
3. **Service Registry**:
    
    * A central repository that provides a centralized directory of services where service providers can publish their services and service consumers can discover and locate them.
        

#### Example Workflow of Web Services

1. **Publish**:
    
    * A service provider defines a web service and publishes its WSDL description to the UDDI registry.
        
2. **Find**:
    
    * A service consumer queries the UDDI registry to find a web service meeting its requirements and retrieves the WSDL description.
        
3. **Bind**:
    
    * The service consumer uses the WSDL description to bind to the service and invoke its operations.
        

#### Benefits of Web Services

1. **Interoperability**:
    
    * Different applications can communicate with each other regardless of their underlying platform.
        
2. **Reusability**:
    
    * Web services promote the reuse of components across different applications and systems.
        
3. **Modularity**:
    
    * Web services allow for the development of modular applications where each service represents a specific business function.
        
4. **Ease of Integration**:
    
    * Simplifies integration tasks by using standard protocols and data formats.
        

#### Security in Web Services

1. **Confidentiality**:
    
    * Ensures that the data is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
        
2. **Integrity**:
    
    * Ensures that the data received is exactly what was sent by the authorized sender.
        
3. **Authentication**:
    
    * Verifies the identity of the parties involved in the communication.
        
4. **Authorization**:
    
    * Ensures that an authenticated entity has the right to access the requested resources.
        

## Basic Web Services Architecture

#### Definition

Web services are standardized ways of integrating web-based applications using open standards such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI over an Internet protocol backbone. Web services allow different applications from different sources to communicate with each other without time-consuming custom coding.

#### Key Components

1. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:
    
    * A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It relies on XML for its message format and usually relies on other application layer protocols, most notably HTTP and SMTP, for message negotiation and transmission.
        
2. **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**:
    
    * An XML-based interface description language that is used for describing the functionality offered by a web service. WSDL describes the services as a collection of endpoints capable of exchanging messages.
        
3. **UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)**:
    
    * A platform-independent, XML-based registry for businesses worldwide to list themselves on the internet. UDDI can also be used to find web services and understand how to interact with them.
        

#### Architecture Overview

The basic architecture of web services involves the following components:

1. **Service Provider**:
    
    * The entity that creates and publishes the web service. The service provider defines the service description and the rules for accessing the service, typically using WSDL.
        
2. **Service Requester**:
    
    * The client application that seeks to locate and invoke a service. The requester uses the service description to discover and bind to the service and invoke it using the specified protocol (usually SOAP over HTTP).
        
3. **Service Registry**:
    
    * A searchable repository where service providers publish their service descriptions. The service registry (typically implemented using UDDI) allows service requesters to find services based on various criteria.
        

#### Web Services Communication

1. **Discovery**:
    
    * The service requester queries the service registry to find a suitable service. The registry returns the service description, which includes information about how to bind to the service.
        
2. **Description**:
    
    * The service provider uses WSDL to describe the service's interface and how to communicate with the service.
        
3. **Invocation**:
    
    * The service requester uses the service description to bind to the service and invoke the necessary operations using SOAP.
        

#### Example Workflow

1. **Publishing a Service**:
    
    * The service provider creates a web service and generates a WSDL document describing the service. This WSDL document is then published to a UDDI registry.
        
2. **Finding a Service**:
    
    * The service requester searches the UDDI registry for a service that meets its requirements. The registry returns the WSDL document for the matching service.
        
3. **Invoking a Service**:
    
    * The service requester uses the information in the WSDL document to bind to the service and invoke its operations using SOAP messages.
        

#### Benefits of Web Services

1. **Interoperability**:
    
    * Web services enable interoperability between different applications and platforms, as they use standard protocols and data formats.
        
2. **Reusability**:
    
    * Services can be reused across different applications and systems, promoting efficiency and reducing redundancy.
        
3. **Scalability**:
    
    * Web services can be scaled to handle increased loads, as they are based on standard protocols that support distributed computing.
        
4. **Loose Coupling**:
    
    * Web services promote loose coupling between client and server applications, as they interact through well-defined interfaces.
        

## Introduction to SOAP

#### Definition

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It uses XML to encode its HTTP-based messages.

#### Key Features

1. **Extensibility**:
    
    * SOAP is designed to be extensible, allowing for the inclusion of additional features as needed.
        
2. **Neutrality**:
    
    * SOAP can operate over any protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, or JMS, making it versatile for different network configurations.
        
3. **Independence**:
    
    * It is platform and language-independent, allowing for communication between different systems and technologies.
        
4. **XML-Based**:
    
    * Uses XML for message format, ensuring that the messages are readable and can be parsed by any XML parser.
        

#### SOAP Message Structure

A SOAP message is an XML document that consists of the following parts:

1. **Envelope**:
    
    * The root element of the XML document, which defines the start and end of the message.
        
2. **Header**:
    
    * An optional element that contains application-specific information such as authentication credentials or transaction controls.
        
3. **Body**:
    
    * Contains the actual SOAP message intended for the recipient. This is where the request or response information is located.
        
4. **Fault**:
    
    * An optional element that provides information about errors that occurred while processing the message.
        

#### SOAP Communication Model

SOAP operates using a request-response model:

1. **Client**:
    
    * Sends a request message to the server.
        
2. **Server**:
    
    * Processes the request and returns a response message.
        

This model can be implemented over various transport protocols, though HTTP is the most common.

#### Example of SOAP Message

A simple example of a SOAP request message to get stock prices might look like:

```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
  <soap:Header>
    <m:Trans xmlns:m="http://www.w3schools.com/transaction/" soap:mustUnderstand="1">234</m:Trans>
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:GetStockPrice xmlns:m="http://www.w3schools.com/prices">
      <m:StockName>IBM</m:StockName>
    </m:GetStockPrice>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

And the corresponding response might look like:

```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
  <soap:Body>
    <m:GetStockPriceResponse xmlns:m="http://www.w3schools.com/prices">
      <m:Price>34.5</m:Price>
    </m:GetStockPriceResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

#### Advantages of SOAP

1. **Platform and Language Independent**:
    
    * Can be used with any programming language and operating system.
        
2. **Standardization**:
    
    * It is a well-defined protocol with a clear structure and rules.
        
3. **Extensibility**:
    
    * Can be extended to include additional functionality and protocols.
        
4. **Security**:
    
    * Supports a variety of security protocols, such as WS-Security, for secure message transmission.
        

#### Disadvantages of SOAP

1. **Complexity**:
    
    * SOAP messages are typically larger and more complex compared to REST, which can result in slower processing and higher bandwidth usage.
        
2. **Performance**:
    
    * XML parsing and the overhead of additional headers can lead to decreased performance.
        
3. **Verbosity**:
    
    * The XML-based message format can be verbose, making it less efficient in terms of data transmission compared to other protocols.
        

#### SOAP vs. REST

1. **Protocol**:
    
    * SOAP is a protocol, while REST is an architectural style.
        
2. **Message Format**:
    
    * SOAP uses XML exclusively, while REST can use XML, JSON, or other formats.
        
3. **Transport**:
    
    * SOAP primarily uses HTTP but can also use other protocols, whereas REST primarily uses HTTP.
        

## WSDL and UDDI

### WSDL (Web Services Description Language)

#### Definition

Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML-based language used to describe the functionalities offered by a web service. It provides a standard way for service providers to describe their services and for service consumers to understand how to interact with these services.

#### Structure of WSDL

A WSDL document is divided into several parts:

1. **Types**:
    
    * Defines the data types used by the web service. This can include complex types defined in XML Schema (XSD).
        
2. **Message**:
    
    * Defines the data elements of an operation. Each message can consist of multiple parts, each part representing a parameter or return value.
        
3. **PortType**:
    
    * Defines a set of operations supported by one or more endpoints. It can be compared to an interface in object-oriented programming.
        
4. **Binding**:
    
    * Specifies the protocol and data format to be used for each operation defined in the portType. It effectively links the abstract definitions to concrete protocols.
        
5. **Service**:
    
    * Groups a set of related endpoints. Each endpoint is defined by a combination of a binding and a network address.
        
6. **Port**:
    
    * A single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.
        

#### Example of a WSDL Document

```xml
<definitions name="HelloService"
             targetNamespace="http://www.example.org/hello"
             xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"
             xmlns:tns="http://www.example.org/hello"
             xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <types>
    <xsd:schema targetNamespace="http://www.example.org/hello">
      <xsd:element name="sayHelloRequest" type="xsd:string"/>
      <xsd:element name="sayHelloResponse" type="xsd:string"/>
    </xsd:schema>
  </types>
  <message name="sayHelloRequest">
    <part name="name" element="tns:sayHelloRequest"/>
  </message>
  <message name="sayHelloResponse">
    <part name="greeting" element="tns:sayHelloResponse"/>
  </message>
  <portType name="HelloPortType">
    <operation name="sayHello">
      <input message="tns:sayHelloRequest"/>
      <output message="tns:sayHelloResponse"/>
    </operation>
  </portType>
  <binding name="HelloBinding" type="tns:HelloPortType">
    <soap:binding transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http"/>
    <operation name="sayHello">
      <soap:operation soapAction="sayHello"/>
      <input>
        <soap:body use="literal"/>
      </input>
      <output>
        <soap:body use="literal"/>
      </output>
    </operation>
  </binding>
  <service name="HelloService">
    <port name="HelloPort" binding="tns:HelloBinding">
      <soap:address location="http://www.example.org/hello"/>
    </port>
  </service>
</definitions>
```

### UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)

#### Definition

Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) is a platform-independent, XML-based registry for businesses worldwide to list themselves on the internet. It enables enterprises to discover each other and define how they interact over the Web.

#### Components of UDDI

1. **Business Entity**:
    
    * Represents the business providing the web service. It includes information such as the business name, description, and contact information.
        
2. **Business Service**:
    
    * Describes the services provided by the business. It can include multiple services offered by the same business.
        
3. **Binding Template**:
    
    * Defines the technical information about a service, such as the access point (URL) and the communication protocol (SOAP, REST).
        
4. **tModel (Technical Model)**:
    
    * Provides a way to describe compliance with technical specifications, categorization, and the technical fingerprint of the service.
        

#### Example of UDDI Usage

1. **Publishing Services**:
    
    * Businesses register their services in the UDDI registry, describing what services they offer and how to access them.
        
2. **Finding Services**:
    
    * Clients search the UDDI registry to find services that meet their requirements. They can search by business, service type, or technical specifications.
        
3. **Binding to Services**:
    
    * Once a service is discovered, clients use the binding template to obtain the necessary information to interact with the service.
        

#### UDDI Data Structures

* **BusinessEntity**:
    
    * Describes the business, including name, description, and contact information.
        
* **BusinessService**:
    
    * Describes the services a business offers.
        
* **BindingTemplate**:
    
    * Provides the technical details about a service's access point.
        
* **tModel**:
    
    * Describes the specifications or standards the service complies with.
        

## REST ful services

### Definition

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP. RESTful services are web services implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST.

### Characteristics

1. **Stateless**:
    
    * Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any state about the client session on the server side.
        
2. **Client-Server Architecture**:
    
    * The client and server are separate entities, with the client handling the user interface and the server managing data storage and processing. This separation allows each to evolve independently.
        
3. **Cacheable**:
    
    * Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests.
        
4. **Uniform Interface**:
    
    * RESTful services have a uniform interface that simplifies and decouples the architecture, which allows each part to evolve independently. This is achieved through a small set of well-defined operations and resources.
        
5. **Layered System**:
    
    * The client does not know whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers can improve system scalability by enabling load balancing and shared caches.
        
6. **Code on Demand (Optional)**:
    
    * Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code. This is optional and can be used to reduce complexity.
        

### Components

1. **Resources**:
    
    * The key abstraction of information in REST. A resource can be any piece of information that can be named, such as a document or image, a temporal service (e.g., "today’s weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g., a person), and so on.
        
2. **Resource Identifiers**:
    
    * Typically URLs, these uniquely identify each resource.
        
3. **Representation**:
    
    * Resources are represented in formats such as JSON, XML, or HTML. These representations are sent from server to client and include data about the resource and metadata describing the data.
        
4. **URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)**:
    
    * Used to identify the resources. RESTful services use URIs to address resources.
        
5. **HTTP Methods**:
    
    * RESTful services use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources:
        
        * **GET**: Retrieve a resource.
            
        * **POST**: Create a new resource.
            
        * **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
            
        * **DELETE**: Delete a resource.
            
6. **HTTP Status Codes**:
    
    * Used to indicate the result of the HTTP request. Common status codes include:
        
        * **200 OK**: The request was successful.
            
        * **201 Created**: A new resource was successfully created.
            
        * **204 No Content**: The request was successful but there is no representation to return.
            
        * **400 Bad Request**: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
            
        * **404 Not Found**: The resource was not found.
            
        * **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.
            

### Types

1. **Resource-Oriented Services**:
    
    * Focused on resources and typically use URIs to identify resources and HTTP methods to manipulate them.
        
2. **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**:
    
    * A constraint of the REST application architecture that keeps the client and server decoupled, allowing the server to dynamically guide the client through the application by providing hypermedia links with each response.
        
3. **Data-Oriented Services**:
    
    * These services focus on exposing data models via RESTful APIs, providing CRUD operations on data entities.
        

#### Example of RESTful Service Interaction

Consider a RESTful web service that manages a collection of users. The interaction might look like this:

* **GET /users**: Retrieves a list of users.
    
* **GET /users/{id}**: Retrieves a specific user by ID.
    
* **POST /users**: Creates a new user.
    
* **PUT /users/{id}**: Updates an existing user.
